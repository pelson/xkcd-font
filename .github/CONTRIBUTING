# Font changes

Please see the respective font READMEs ([xkcd-script](xkcd-script/README.md) &
[xkcd](xkcd/README.md)) for guidance on how to contribute a change to a font.


## Continuous integration

This repository makes use of TravisCI to automatically build and push any
changes back into the respective build directories. This means that technically
you may make a change to the font input (e.g. code/template/image) without
needing to make a change to the built fonts. In order for this to work, we have
been careful to ensure that the built fonts are deterministic (that is, they
produce *exactly* the same file each time they are re-built) - it is important
that this property is preserved with each change.
