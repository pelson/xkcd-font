## xkcd-script

A font derrived from a handwriting sample provided by Randall. It is far less uniform than xkcd-regular, and we think it is therefore more like a true
script font.

## xkcd-uniform

The official xkcd font, as used on [xkcd.com](http://xkcd.com/1227/) and the April 1st, 2013 generated comic may be found in the archive: {}

The original font file comes from @randallmunroe, the original font author and xkcd webcomic author. Yes, it's his handwriting. He gave us permission and hopes we [fix the pesky kerning](http://xkcd.com/1015/).
