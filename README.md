# xkcd-font

Fonts derived from the handwriting of @randallmunroe, the [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) webcomic author.
Yes, it really is his handwriting, and he hopes we [fix the pesky kerning](http://xkcd.com/1015/):

This repository contains two fonts, xkcd-script and xkcd-uniform, each with their own characteristics (and limitations):

### xkcd-script

A font derrived from a handwriting sample provided by Randall.
It is far less uniform than xkcd-uniform, and we think it is therefore more like a true
script font.

### xkcd-uniform

A font that was created originally by Randall, and was used on [xkcd "The Pace of Modern Life" (April 1st, 2013)](https://xkcd.com/1227/).
